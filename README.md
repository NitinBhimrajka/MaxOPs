# MaxOPs
<b>Project Description</b>

The maximum limit of Unsigned Long Int in C/C++ is 18446744073709551615, a 20  digit number. While languages like C++/Java support classes of BigIntegers (100 digit numbers). C by default has no such support. This project aims to bring that support to the C language along with basic arithmetic operations like Comparison, Addition, Subtraction, and Multiplication along with applications such as Factorial, Fibonacci, etc.

Project Language(s)

C



Prerequisite(s)

Arrays, Basic Mathematics, Basic programming experience in C


Objective


Add support for Big Integers (numbers greater than 18446744073709551615) in C along with basic mathematical operations and functions.





Project Context


Languages like C++/Java support classes like allowing Bigintegers developers to utilize numbers with up to 100 digits. MAXOP aims to provide support up to 1000 digits in the C language along with basic mathematical operations (comparison, addition, subtraction, multiplication) and some mathematical functions (Fibonacci series, factorial). 





Applications


• Calculate factorial of very large integers
• Calculate the very large nth Fibonacci number
• Calculate the binomial coefficient of very large numbers
• Perform binary exponentiation on very large numbers or raise numbers to very large powers
• Greatest Common Divisor
